                    <p class="desc_text">  I have created a sum total for all of the 27 EU states excluding the UK,
                        and graphed this against the UK daily total.  I also wanted to create two break out charts showing the spanish adjustment to their count,
                        and the rather shocking confirmation of the Daily Mirror article.</p>

                    Although the drop off of the EU deaths is significantly steeper, which may be due to stricter lockdown measures.

                            I'm not sure what this really means for our data, whether the Spanish were previously over-reporting deaths, 
                            or from this point on they are under-reporting...</p>
