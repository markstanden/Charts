# Charts

- One of my first JavaScript projects which formed part of the OneMonth JavaScript course.
- I was tasked with building a webpage which utilised the Google Charts API and could use any data set I wished.

## Covid-19

- At the time the UK government were in the news for having more deaths in a single day then the rest of the EU combined.
- I decided that this was most likely negative spin, as the UK has a tiny populatin compared to the EU as a whole.

-  The site used data downloaded from the EU's public data portal, which I deemed trustworthy enough.

### Results

- The results were surprising

## What I learnt here

- Mainly passing arrays between functions and parsing CSV files and JSON.
- I had to do a lot of manipulation to the data to convert it to the correct format for Google Charts.
- The Google Charts API served it's purpose, but to be honest I didn't really enjoy using it.
- The charts felt pretty basic.
